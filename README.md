# Reinforcement-learning

An algorithm of reinforcement learning impleted to control the behavior of an agent that has to clear a maze in Unity.

This repository contains two unity projects. 

In project 1 the agent not only have to clear the maze, but also avoid been hitted by an enemy agent.

In project 2 the complexity of the task has been simplyfied to make posible the visualization of the rewards table.

In "PEC3/Datos" the evolution of the average reward value has been stored.

In "PEC3/Entrega" some videos of the agent behavior have been stored.
